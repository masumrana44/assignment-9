                <h3>Q-1:<small>What is the purpose of React Router?</small></h3>
                <h6>Ans:-<small>The Router in React JS is primarily used to create Single Page 
                    Web Apps. In the application, React Router is utilized to define various 
                    routes. When a user enters a URL into your browser and the URL route equals 
                    one of several 'pathways' as in the router folder, the user is sent to 
                    that route.</small></h6>
                <h3>Q-2:<small>How does work context api?</small></h3>
                <h6>Ans:-<small>The Context API helps share data between components which you 
                    can't easily share with props, for example, complex data objects. React 
                    Context API provides a way to send data like userid, auth, and theme data 
                    through the component tree without sending any props manually at every 
                    level.</small></h6>
